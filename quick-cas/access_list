# quick-cas/access_list
# ---------------------------------------------
# One regular expression per line.
# - Blank lines and lines starting with '#' are ignored.
# - You may use either raw regex (weâ€™ll wrap it as "~...~i") or a fully
#   delimited pattern yourself (e.g., "~^https://...~i").
# - Behavior is controlled by ACCESS_SERVICE_LIST_TYPE in quick-cas.php:
#     ALLOW: service is permitted if it matches ANY regex in this file (or in ACCESS_SERVICE_LIST).
#            If no regexes are present, ALL services are allowed (to avoid lockout).
#     BLOCK: service is denied if it matches ANY regex. If none match, the service is allowed.
#
# Examples (uncomment and adapt as needed):
#
# Allow *.seas.upenn.edu
# ^https://[^/]+\.seas\.upenn\.edu(/|$)
#
# Allow a specific ngrok callback
# ^https://[A-Za-z0-9-]+\.ngrok-free\.app(/|$)
#
# Block Google (when using BLOCK policy)
# ^https?://(www\.)?google\.com(/|$)
#
# Notes:
# - We enforce HTTPS by default (ACCESS_ENFORCE_HTTPS = true) regardless of patterns.
# - Matching is done against the FULL service URL as passed to /login (scheme, host, path, query).
